> Grunt task to include files and replace variables. Allows for parameterised includes and conditional if blocks.

##Features

### Parameterised file includes:

**hello.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
{{ include('/path/to/include/message.html', {"name": "Joe Bloggs"}) }}
```

**message.html**

```html
<p>Hello, {{ name }}!</p>
```

**Result:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Hello, Joe Bloggs!</p>
```

### Conditional if blocks

**hello.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
{{ include('/path/to/include/message.html', {"name": "Joe Bloggs", "morning": true}) }}
```

**message.html**


```html
{{ if morning }}
<p>Good morning, {{ name }}!</p>
{{ endif }}

{{ if afternoon }}
<p>Good afternoon, {{ name }}!</p>
{{ endif }}
```

**Result:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Good morning, Joe Bloggs!</p>
```

### Custom variables

```html
{{ var $size-1: "small" }}
{{ var $size-2: "medium" }}
{{ var $size-3: "large" }}

<p>My cat is $size-1.</p>
<p>My dog is $size-2.</p>
<p>My horse is $size-3.</p>
<p>But all of them have things that are $size-1, $size-2 and $size-3 in relation to their own size.</p>

{{ include('inc.html', {"biggest": "$size-3"}) }}
```

**inc.html**

```html
<hr />
<p>But which is the biggest size? {{ biggest }}</p>
```

**Result:**

```html
<p>My cat is small.</p>
<p>My dog is medium.</p>
<p>My horse is large.</p>
<p>But all of them have things that are small, medium and large in relation to their own size.</p>

<hr />
<p>But which is the biggest size? large</p>
```

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-include-replace-more --save-dev
```

One the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-include-replace-more');
```

## The "includereplacemore" task


### Overview

The task allows you to preprocess your project file contents by replacing placeholder "variables" and including content from other files. In addition to "global" variables that are replaced in all files you specify, the task introduces the concept of "local" variables, which are passed as parameters to included files.

WARNING: The task _does not_ check for recursive includes.

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `includereplacemore` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  includereplacemore: {
    your_target: {
      options: {
        // Task-specific options go here.
      }
      // Files to perform replacements and includes with
      src: '*.html',
      // Destination directory to copy files to
      dest: 'dist/'
    }
  }
})
```

### Options

#### options.globals
Type: `Object`
Default value: `{}`

Global variables availabe for replacement in all files.

#### options.prefix
Type: `String`
Default value: `{{ `

Variable/include directive prefix. Careful when changing as it is added to the regular expression used for finding variables to be replaced.

Must be at least 1 character, otherwise resets to default value.

#### options.suffix
Type: `String`
Default value: ` }}`

Variable/include directive suffix. Careful when changing as it is added to the regular expression used for finding variables to be replaced.

Must be at least 1 character, otherwise resets to default value.

#### options.startIf
Type: `String`
Default value: `if `

If variable directive prefix. Careful when changing as it is added to the regular expression used for finding variables to be replaced.

Must be at least 1 character, otherwise resets to default value.

#### options.endIf
Type: `String`
Default value: `endif`

If variable directive suffix. Careful when changing as it is added to the regular expression used for finding variables to be replaced.

Must be at least 1 character, otherwise resets to default value.

#### options.includesDir
Type: `String`
Default value: Relative to including file

Directory where includes will be resolved.

#### options.docroot
Type: `String`
Default value: `.`

`{{ docroot }}` is a magic local variable that contains the relative path from the file that uses it to the path specified.

#### options.processIncludeContents
Type: `Function`
Default value: undefined

A function called for every included file prior to processing by `grunt-include-replace`. It is passed the include file contents and local variables as parameters and should return the (possibly altered) file contents.

### Usage Examples

#### Default Options

```javascript
includereplacemore: {
  dist: {
    options: {
      globals: {
        var1: 'one',
        var2: 'two',
        var3: 'three'
      },
    },
    src: '*.html',
    dest: 'dist/'
  }
}
```

##### Files array format

```javascript
includereplacemore: {
  dist: {
    options: {
      globals: {
        var1: 'one',
        var2: 'two',
        var3: 'three'
      },
    },
    files: [
      {src: 'js/**/*.js', dest: 'dist/', expand: true, cwd: 'src/'},
      {src: '*.css', dest: 'dist/css/', expand: true, cwd: 'src/css'}
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Files object format

```javascript
includereplacemore: {
  dist: {
    options: {
      globals: {
        var1: 'one',
        var2: 'two',
        var3: 'three'
      },
    },
    files: {
      'dist/js/': ['**/*.js', '!dist/**/*.js'],
      'dist/css/': ['**/*.css', '!dist/**/*.css']
    }
  }
}
```

#### Custom Options

The following example allows include statements to appear as comments in HTML files by altering the prefix and suffix. The prefix and suffix for conditional IF blocks is also changed. Also all includes are resolved relative to the directory `inc/` (relative to your Gruntfile) rather than relative to including file.

```javascript
includereplacemore: {
  dist: {
    options: {
      prefix: '<!-- {{',
      suffix: ' -->',
      startIf: ' _if_ ',
      endIf: ' _endif_ ',
      includesDir: 'inc/'
    },
    src: '*.html',
    dest: 'dist/'
  }
}
```
